# FAMJAM! 
A task and reposibilities management tool for busy families.

[See my trello board!](trello.com/b/uXURcotB)

[Check out FamilyJam on Heroku](http://familyjam.herokuapp.com/)

## Summary 
FamilyJam is an app for busy families that need a todo list. Getting started is simple, to create a profile all you need is your name, email and a clever username, and thats it! After signing up, you will have an empty dashboard waiting for you to enter todos, add due dates, give members todos, and attach notes to each todos so you never forget why your created it in the first place

## MVP Specs
- Each user will be able to create an account on FamJam
- Each user will have the ability to create tasks
- Each user will have the ability to add a description to each task 
- Each user will have the ability to delete a task they completed or no longer need to do.

## FamilyJam was built using...
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript (ofcourse!)
- Ruby on Rails
- Postgres DB
- Bcrypt for password protection (Gem)
- Byebug for debugging (Gem)
- RESTful routing
- [Deployed on Heroku!](http://familyjam.herokuapp.com/)


## Stretch Goals
- Give users the ability to create families so other users can see and assign tasks to eachother.
- Give users the ability to comment to eachother within tasks.
- Give users the ability to upload an image when they sign up.
- Add visual indicators for the current status of the tasks.

## Problems 
- Problem 1: Could not find a way to allow users to create families and add members within that family. 
- Problem 2: Could not find a way to to allow users to assign due dates to each task.
